1 game on paper at lunch

TRIED: spells are targetted immediately and resolve on the next battle phase
 - L missed a cool opportunity when R's board was empty to zap the creature he knew i would probably cast before battle
 - felt like the game flow was cleaner
 - makes blast less useful
 - overall seems like a gain

BALANCE
 - want/need more creature removal
 - want/need more multi-hit spells (AOE & chains)
 - melee/archer stack in middle row is insanely powerful. better removal and more high-HP walls will help
 
RULE CHANGES:
 - clutter is now cast as a summon rather than a battle spell
 - clutter tokens are removed at beginning of turn instead of end
 - spells are resolved at next battle phase
 - tier 3 wall changed from 0-6 to 0-7 to survive T3 melee/archer stack

THEME
 - board is a map
 - units are "actually" generals or commanders
 - equipment slots (on commanders) are "actually" the units they command
 - puts flanking into context
 - feels more epic

played 2 or 3 games on paper, 20-30 minutes each

MISC NOTES: 
- Had 3 tech+ cards in opening hand, was hugely powerful speed
- Early clutters to block the anchor spot is power
- Clutter + militia was really powerful to sneak damage through the cluttered anchor point

RULES: beneficial spells resolve first, then negative spells

BALANCE: all basic archers should have only 1 health

DESIGN CONCERN: how to illustrate that all creatures can deal damage, which sometimes happens after they've already "died"

TRY:
 - to encourage spells, require a spell or reinforce in the first phase, and a creature in the 2nd (could make spell combos easier instead of always casting reactively BC creature momentum is so important)
 - both players draw from the same deck, either a special theme deck or they just shuffle their cards together
 - archers can only hit front row, and can NOT hit players. acts as a potential solution to the power of the melee-archer stack by only letting them control one space instead of the whole column
 - spells can't be saved at all. they are instantly targetted when cast and go off during the next battle (reduces a major decision point and a somewhat confusing idea of storing spells). spells w/ incubation periods could allow for stacking/combos.

removed mechanic of adding clutter whenever a unit dies
added techdown as a balancing factor to kill & militia
decided militia is amazing

Intent: Build game w/ high lifetime revenue potential per player that is relatively simple to build

Helpful qualities: 
 - web based
 - ongoing revenue (virtual goods, subscriptions, expansions, tournaments)
 - low asset cost
 - strong player acquisition strategy (need to work on this...)
 - multiple access points (web, phone, widgets, etc)
 - reward frequent engagement (log in, get reward, always want to look at it)
 
Play: Fun
 - quick turns, no waiting
 - meaningful decisions
 - multiple strategies
 - creative deck building
 - imperfect knowledge of game state
 - minimize bad draws & "mana screw"

Genre: Card game
 - collectible
 - tournaments
 - drafts
 - gambling
 - expiring content
 - rarity & value
 
 
 
(pyramid shaped board, front rows protect units behind them)
 
Initial gameplay notes

Abilities
 - Melee attacks what is directly in front of it
 - Trample damages unit behind initial target
 - Archery skips over one spot
 - First strike can avoid retalation
 - Immaterial doesn't count as a blocker but still attacks
 - Flying can attack anywhere on board (but in danger from archers)
 
Heroes
 - Heroes begin in the back spot and create game-wide effects
 - You win by killing the enemy hero
 - Heroes can have wildly different life totals, card drawing capacity, etc
   - life
   - spell slots
   - hand size (starting & max)
   - play/attack speed
   - equipment slots
 - Could maybe level up during battle & gain new skills
 - could get more powerful as you tech up
 - can have their own win conditions
   - reach tech level X
   - survive X turns
   - fill your whole board
 
 
Effects
 - Certain creatures only summonable to a certain row/spot
 - Render a tile unusable for building
 - Turn a tile into a melee wall that archers can still shoot over


EARLY DESIGN MISTAKES:
 - too many choice points
   - initially imagined you could choose which lane to attack down
 - abilities & effects that increase choice points (flying, etc)



Turn phases
- I draw 2
- I cast
- We both attack
- I cast
- Your turn



Battle spells
 - in the case of non-targetted spells (militia) maybe drag them to a target anyway for consistency
 - play it to a staging area
 - can trigger it at any point in the future during a battle
 - can save up multiple spells
 - possible combo effects from saved up spells
 - NOTE: i think this was a mistake. spells should be targetted immediately and go into effect during the next battle phase (they can be hidden until then)
 

Summoning
 - can summon over top an old creature, killing it?
 - can reinforce by summoning on top of another creature, giving it +x+x until end of turn (after which the reinforcer dies)

Equipment
 - can increase grind by allowing you to equip your cards during deck building
 




ECONOMIES

4 options
- saveable time (spectro)
- true time (warstorm)
- saveable specialty (elements)
- non-saveable specialty (mtg)

First 2 options stop you from getting mana screwed
Last 2 make for more interesting deck building.

Possible economies
- Happy workers: # of units alive is your tech level. tough to advance fast bc early units die fast
- sacrificial - can sac any card in your hand to boost your tech. might or may not take a turn.
- hero abilities: hero dictates how much tech you get
- pure strategic: can boost tech for no cost instead of casting or attacking
- mining: special summon slot where unit attacks a mine for resources
- food - you can support X troops based on how much they eat
- RTS - you buy resource gatherers and give them jobs (doesn't work w/ pen & paper)



(at this point I started playing solitaire games on paper and made the initial set of cards, then played 2 player)
